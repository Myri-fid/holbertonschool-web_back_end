Python - Asynchronous Programming Public
What is Asynchronous Programming?
In traditional synchronous programming, each operation is executed one after the other. If one operation takes time (like fetching data from the internet), the entire program waits and nothing else progresses.

Asynchronous programming allows certain operations to be executed in the “background”, freeing up the main program to continue running. This is especially useful for I/O-bound operations like network requests, file operations, etc.

Python - Asynchronous execution Public
Coroutines and the async/await syntax in Python are used to write asynchronous code that can perform tasks concurrently without the need for threads or processes. This is particularly useful for I/O-bound tasks, like web requests or database queries, where you’d otherwise be waiting for a response and wasting CPU cycles and where traditional threading or multiprocessing might be overkill or introduce unnecessary complexity.
